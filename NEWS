libspectre 0.2.1 (10 August 2008)
=================================

This is a bugfix only release. There are no API changes at all.

Fixes and improvements in the PostScript parser:

 - Support DOS EPS files (Bug #16810)
 - A work around for some invalid documents generated by some versions
   of Mozilla has been added. (Bug #14384)
 - PS-AdobeFont comments are not considered as begining of a nested
   document anymore so that the font code is not ignored. 

Portability fixes:

 - Alternative implementation of spectre_strdup_vprintf for platforms
   where vasprintf is not available (Bug #15127)
 - Implement _spectre_get_pid for win32 (Bug #16309)
 - Open files in binary mode for win32 compatibility (Bug #16309)
 - Fix endianness bug
   
Several cleanups and improvements have been made in the code and lots
of compile warnings have been fixed. 


libspectre 0.2.0 (03 January 2008)
==================================

API additions:

 - Rendering unstructured documents: it's a bit confusing calling
   get_page for a document with no pages. The following functions has
   been added for rendering unstructured documents:
   
    * spectre_document_render
    * spectre_document_render_full
    * spectre_document_get_page_size
   
 - Tile rendering: spectre_page_render_slice has been added to allow
   rendering rectangles of the page. (Bug #13754)

API changes:

 - spectre_render_context_set_page_size determines the size of the
   output image, but it doesn't affect the scale factor anymore.

 - spectre_render_context_[set|get]_scale now require the scale factor for
   both the X and Y dimensions.
