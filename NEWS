libspectre 0.2.0 (03 January 2008)
==================================

API additions:

 - Rendering unstructured documents: it's a bit confusing calling
   get_page for a document with no pages. The following functions has
   been added for rendering unstructured documents:
   
    * spectre_document_render
    * spectre_document_render_full
    * spectre_document_get_page_size
   
 - Tile rendering: spectre_page_render_slice has been added to allow
   rendering rectangles of the page. (Bug #13754)

API changes:

 - spectre_render_context_set_page_size determines the size of the
   output image, but it doesn't affect the scale factor anymore.

 - spectre_render_context_[set|get]_scale now require the scale factor for
   both the X and Y dimensions.
